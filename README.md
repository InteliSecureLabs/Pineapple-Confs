<h2>This Project</h2>
The Pineapple's originally cost approximately $200+(USD) recently the price has dropped to a more affordable $100(USD).
This is Pentura's take on forking the project to build an even cheaper clone, for University Undergraduates / Researchers with a limited budget.
With a maximum target of $50(USD), we set up to build an alternative model.

Our Solution:
<ul>
<li>TPLink WR703N - $20(USD)
<li> USB Flash Cruzer - $10(USD)
</ul>
<h2>TPLink Pineapple Mods</h2>
The php interface can be found in the following forked project: https://github.com/PenturaLabs/web-interface.

This repository contains addtional binaries and configuration material:
<ul>
<li><strong>/etc/</strong> contains the configurations that have been modified compared to a base openwrt install</li>
<li><strong>/usr/</strong> contains the patched hostapd and hostapd_cli</li>
</ul>
